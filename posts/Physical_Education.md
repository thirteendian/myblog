<p class="intro">
There are many internet contents talking about fitness and health, 
up to the newest peer review journals, down to social media videos. 
In this blog, I will sum up
all of my approachable contents, classified the topics into: Of Eat, Of Anaerobic, Of Cardio, Of Supplement. Of eat, we talked about 
the arrangement of Carbohydrate, Fat and Protein; Of Anaerobic, we talked about 4-split training arrangements including:
Back+Front Shoulder, Chest+Back Shoulder, Arms, Legs+Abdomen; Of Cardio, we talked about the running, hiking and swimming;
Of Supplement, we talked about Muscle Grow and Fat Loss, as well as those influence on Muscle System, Cardiovascular System, Digestive System, and Endocrine System. The resources
is included in Footnote.

## Of Eat

>What is GI？
GI described the decomposition rate of carbohydrate in this type of food. Thus, to compare food, we need to make sure they
contain the same amount of carbohydrate.

### Total Amount

> Weight Loss does not means weight loss only, it means fat loss under body build

The bodyWeight Factor times body weight (in kg) determined in total grams of intake.

| Carbohydrate        | Protein | Fat     |
|---------------------|---------|---------|
| 2.5 - 3.5 (up to 4) | 2 - 2.5 | 0.8 - 1 |

For Carbohydrate, NSCA-CSCS recommendation is 5-6, while NASM-CPT recommends 6-10, which is not suitable for common people.
The total amount carbohydrate intake should give more to big muscle training day, but less to small muscle. 
Leg/back>Chest>Shoulder/Arm>Other.

> Note that if controlling food too strict may cause Orthorexia(Eating Disorder) and recurrent Binge Eating,
> so it is not necessary to be too serious on "Clean Food"!
### Carbohydrate

Carbon controls main food energy deficit and insulin.

| Morning  | Before Training | After Training |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 30%      | 20%(low GI)     | 50% (high GI)  |

Before workout, an mid-GI carbohydrate is recommended. Examples: one banana, sweetcorn, etc.

After workout, raising up insulin, helps glycemia and amino acid(AA) to move into fat and muscle. It will
increase fat and muscle at the same time, but since the only chance to increase muscle, it is cost-effective.
It requires to eat Carbohydrate within 30 mins of workout.

Other time, we need to make full use of it, resist insulin, to lose fat. It requires no or less carbohydrate intake
on other meals or at relax/aerobic day.


### Protein 

Average 3-5 times a day.

### Fat

Avoid the solid fat will be a helpful way to avoid overtaking of fat, for example, avoid nuts, cakes, and fat meat.

## Of Anaerobic Exercise

### Division

| Day 1                | Day 2                  | Day3                               | Day 4          | Day other    |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Back + Back Shoulder | Chest + Front Shoulder | Biceps + Triceps + Middle Shoulder | Leg+ Abdominal | Aerobic Only |

Always 4 sets of 3-4 types of motion, with 8-12 RM. Free complex motion first.

For Abdominal, more sessions maybe added up to 6 times a week. 

### Back & Back Shoulder
<img class="fullWidthImage" src="/figure/Physical_Education_Back.jpg" loading="lazy">

1. Latissimus Dorsi（背闊肌）: Back width.
2. Trapeziu（斜方肌）: Thickness.
3. Erector Spinae（豎脊肌）: Curve Vertebral Column.
4. Posterior Deltoid: Horizontal shoulder abduction


For Latissium Dorsi(Back width), divided into Pull and Row.
`Pull down` requires shoulder width pronated grip, pull down to front.
Row, recommended `T-bar Chest Support Row(Machine)`, stabilizing the lower back.
`Pull up` is similar to Pull down, but more biceps involved.

For Trapeziu: `High-Rope FacePull` for mid-Trapeziu & Rear Delts, `Mid-Rope FacePull`(with
external rotation and scapular elevation),
for rotator curf & Delts.

For Erector Spinae: `Bent Over Barbell Row`. Note that Squats and Deadlift will involve
this muscle as well, thus at least two day internal between back and leg.

For Posterior Deltoid, `Reverse Pack Deck Fly` in both machine and Dumbbell.

### Chest & Front Shoulder

<img src="/figure/Physical_Education_Chest.jpg" class="fullWidthImage" loading="lazy">

1. Pectoralis Major: 3 head forms a whole chest muscle.
2. Anterior Deltoid: Front Raise up.

Chest muscle connects upper arm, motion is Shoulder joint horizontal clip motion. 
That requires all motion, 
grip wilder than shoulder.

Motion is classified into 3 classes: 
Of lateral press(90 degree), 
Of incline press(arm-head acute, arm-abd obtuse), 
Of decline press(arm-head obtuse, arm-abd acute). 

All `Bench Press` should make lower arm be vertical to ground. 
All press requires scapula（肩胛骨) sink(but not intend).
All press requires full grip, with slight lie down wrist to make platform
Decline down to nipples line, narrow grip; 
Lateral in the middle, normal grip;
Incline up to clavicle downside, wider grip, bench 30 degree.
Last of final set can hold for a while at extension position for blood concentration.

`Dumbbell Press` suggested grip inner side, to prevent it falling inside. Does not need clip motion 

`Push-ups` includes 3 motions at the same time, while start from lateral,
press up as decline, press down as incline. 

`Bar-Dip` is decline, thus try to avoid straight up&down(which turn it into triceps training).
1. Hip flexed, feet pointing forward, ass back, upper body lining forward.
2. Arched back, drawn chest.
3. Grip wider than shoulder


For Anterior Deltoid, `Sitting Dumbbell Press`, or other freestyle is more efficient than
barbell stable grip.

### Arms & Back Shoulder

<img src="/figure/Physical_Education_Arm.jpg" loading="lazy" class="fullWidthImage">

1. Biceps Brachii: Main muscle
2. Brachialis: Push Biceps out, Elbow Flexor(doesn't cross shoulder joint)
3. Coracobrachialis:
4. Triceps Brachii(Long, Medial, Lateral): Biggest muscle, Shoulder extension
5. Laterial Deltoid: Arm lateral raise

Focusing on isolation movement only.

For Biceps Brachii and Brachialis,`Stand T-bar Curl` with wider grip,
`Preacher Chair Curl` with wider grip,
and `Stand Dumbbell Curl` with rotating grip.
All heavy loaded, lower reps(4-8), performed at the beginning,
final few sets considering more on eccentric movement(unfold).
Chair Curl stimulate the most at the first 1/3, while others at the end 1/3.

For Triceps, `Barbel` with narrow grip, `Triceps Press Down` for lateral head, 
`Overhead Triceps Extension` for long head.
All heavy loaded, lower reps(4-8)


For Laterial Deltoid, `Lateral Dumbell Raising UP`.
`Upright Row` requires shoulder grip, elbow alleviation below shoulder
to prevent injuries, a flexible version is `Rope Upright Row` with more flexible.


### Legs

<img src="/figure/Physical_Education_Leg.jpg" class="fullWidthImage" loading="lazy">

`Back Squat` for all.  Bar stop as high as armpit. Bar on upper back protects the lower back.
At the beginning, for protecting the knee, push up the bar by feet under bar and pushing hips forward (not by knee).
After bar on back, moving back for 3 steps, step 1 with left leg(non-dominant leg), 
immediate step 2 with right leg(dominant leg),
step 3 with mini step of left leg to make parallel stand.
Then feet out for 15-30 degree.
Then Brace, heel and toe share the force, elbow slight pointing back(not vertical to ground), inhale to tight core.
Then Descend, push knee forward and out, with bar straight down, all the way to bottom.
Then Up, keeping head slight up.

`Front Squat` more for Vastus Lateralis. The deeper the squat, the more stimulations.
No difference between different stand width.

For Rectus Femoris, `Leg Extension` is better after complex squat, with feet pointing out.
Avoid this motion if ACL is pain.

`Deadlift`.

`Leg Curl`, while pointing toe to the region that trying to activate.

### Abdomen

<img class="fullWidthImage" src="/figure/Physical_Education_Abdomen.jpg" alt="Abdomen" loading="lazy"/>


>Build abds with training, but view it through diet!

1. Rectus Abdominis: 6-packs 
2. Transverse Abdominis(TVA): Compression, Aids Core
3. External Oblique: Flex spine, Rotation, Compression
4. Internal Oblique: Flex lateral, Rotation

For Rectus Abdominis, 
`Crunches` with arms extended helps the upper part. 
`Hanging Leg Raises` helps the lower part. Using weight for lower reps(8-10) and 
light weight(body weight, etc.) for higher reps (up to 30).

For Oblique, 
`Roman Chair Oblique Twists`, rotate while lifting legs, the range of motion is not critical.
`Dumbbell Side Bend`. Inhale while down to dumbbell side, exhale and contracting
the opposite side of oblique, however, this is not recommended because no twist motion is involved.

>All Abd training should do with "round back" rather than "arched back".

Add  lower back exercises on the same day. If Squats and Dead-lift, no extra is needed;
If not, add `Superman Lower Back` exercise.

>Squat and Dead-lift does not help Abd. Stand with Bosu Ball does not help Abd. Ultra-high reps
> does not help Abd.

## Of Supplement

### Fat Loss

Fat Loss Supplement can be divided into 5 classes:
Of Oxidation Enhancers, Of Thermogenics, Of Hunger Suppressors, Of Nutrient Blockers,
and Of Drugs.

Of Oxidation Enhancers;
`L-Carnitine`, lacks strong evidence. 
`CLA`, super small effect. 





Caffeine

Capsaicin

Ephedrine

Yohimbine

#### Hunger Suppressors

Ginger lacks strong evidence

5-HTP lacks strong evidence

#### Nutrient Blockers

Fat-binders digestive issues

Carb-blockers lacks strong evidence
