## Spring Cross Origin

[React.js and Spring Data REST](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/)
We want frontend and backend to be seperated, and communicate with JSON.

however, for example, the default react origin is "localhost:3000", but
the spring controller's origin is mount on "localhost:12345"(configured in myproporities)

We need package:
>org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient

And add allow cross origin annotation in front of controller

```java
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000")
@GetMapping(...)
        ...
```
## Essential library

babel.min.js has two functionality:

* ES6 ==> ES5
* JSX ==> JS

react.development.js is React Core

react-dom.development.js is React extension for Dom

For react component, constructor is called once during initialization, instantiation is got by react, everytime when
state is changing, spring will call render once().

To avoid the changing of `this` in object method, one can defined the method by assignment `()=>`.

`react.development.js` and `babel.min.js` combined has several grammer sugar, for example, JS does not support the
Spread syntax(...)
to be used directly(Only in ReactDom.render to give component label), but react support in JS

```js
var p = new A();
console.log(...p)
//error, since ...p is illegal

var d = {...p, additional: "something"}
//correct, since grammer of deep copy an object
```

in JSX+react

```jsx
console.log(...p)
//correct, since react support the usage of ... directly
//BUT no output
//React only support label to use ... directly
```

Note that to comment on jsx return command of structure, we need to translate to js first by `()` then use JS normal way
to comment it

```jsx
render()
{
    return (
        (/*<input ref={(currNode)=>{this.refinput = currNode}}*/)
        //now it is commentted successfully
    )
```

## Three essential properties

For refs, It's not recommended to use too much. The input parameter is the current element node it self, there are three ways:
```jsx
////////////////////////
//For Arrow function way
class example extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <input ref={(currNode) => {
                this.refinput = currNode
            }}/>
            //here the currNode is <input...> it self    
            //we now add this ref to this class instantiation as refinput
            //And this ()=>{} function will be called twice when render() the page
            //because each time it's a new function
            //react will send null first to make sure it's clear
        )
    }
}

reactDOM.render(<example/>, document.getElementById('test'))
////////////////////
//Bound this function in class
class example extends React.Component {
    refFunction = (currNode) => {
        this.example = currNode;
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <input ref={this.refFunction}/>
        )
    }
}

reactDOM.render(<example/>, document.getElementById('test'))

//////////////////
//use createRef
class example extends React.Component {
    //create a container get all refs
    //but this container will be covered if the label name is the same
    //So we need to singly call createRef()
    refFunction = React.createRef()
    refFunction1 = React.createRef()
    render() {
        return (
            <input ref={this.refFunction}/>
            <input ref={this.refFunction1}/>
        )
    }
}

reactDOM.render(<example/>, document.getElementById('test'))
```

If the event is on the element that call ref itself, the ref is not necessary to define, since
render will return `event` to the same name function as input, and we can get the element by`event.target`

## Event

The Event process
...

Event is rewrite by React(for example, onclick is "onClick"" in react),
and give the event to the very outsider element.

## Diff algorithm

Virtual DOM use label as a comparable minimum element. And compare label from outside to inside.



For react, where accept the data, where need to define data method.


For CORS problem, is able to send, but not possible to receive
The proxy is running on the proxy server is the same port as client,
but do not have ajax wall.

## Fetch and sync await
Separation of Concerns, Fetch and XHR(HMLHttpRequest):
XHR and it's related method(jQuary & Axios) is not suitable for SoC.
Fetch will seperate XHR connect and request data into few steps. May combine
await sync function to curry the responce info and try catch to solve throw error

```jsx
//async function
async ()=>{
    try(){
    const response = await fetch("/url")//step 1 connect Promise
        //response is the first step pending Promise
    const data = await response.json()//step 2 fetch data Promise
    console.log(data)
    }catch (e) {
        //solve error that throwed by above two steps
    }
}
```

## Router

SPA single page application through router.
SPA urls(actually called path, because do not have actual html page url)
now corresponding to multiple Component(or Functions).
* Backend Router, key is path, value is function, like spring controller
* Frontend Router(Hash Router with #), key is component. Corresponding to browser's history(BOM's history).
