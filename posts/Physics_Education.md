<p class="intro">
There are many internet contents talking about fitness and health, for example, yellow page<a href="https://www.exrx.net">ExRx.net</a>,
ATHLEAN-X video channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/athleanx">Jeff's Youtube Channel</a>. There are also many other
very good resources, up to the newest peer review journals, down to BiliBili videos. In this blog, I will sum up
all of my approachable contents, classified the topics into: Of Eat, Of Anaerobic, Of Cardio, Of Supplement.

## Of Eat

### What is GI？
GI described the decomposition rate of carbohydrate in this type of food. Thus, to compare food, we need to make sure they
contain the same amount of carbohydrate.

### Total Amount

> Weight Loss does not means weight loss only, it means fat loss under body build

The bodyWeight Factor times body weight (in kg) determined in total grams of intake.

| Carbohydrate        | Protein | Fat     |
|---------------------|---------|---------|
| 2.5 - 3.5 (up to 4) | 2 - 2.5 | 0.8 - 1 |

For Carbohydrate, NSCA-CSCS recommendation is 5-6, while NASM-CPT recommends 6-10, which is not suitable for common people.
The total amount carbohydrate intake should give more to big muscle training day, but less to small muscle. 
Leg/back>Chest>Shoulder/Arm>Other.

### Carbohydrate

Carbon controls main food energy deficit and insulin.

| Morning  | Before Training | After Training |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 30%      | 20%(low GI)     | 50% (high GI)  |

Before workout, an mid-GI carbohydrate is recommended. Examples: one banana, sweetcorn, etc.

After workout, raising up insulin, helps glycemia and amino acid(AA) to move into fat and muscle. It will
increase fat and muscle at the same time, but since the only chance to increase muscle, it is cost-effective.
It requires to eat Carbohydrate within 30 mins of workout.

Other time, we need to make full use of it, resist insulin, to lose fat. It requires no or less carbohydrate intake
on other meals or at relax/aerobic day.


### Protein 

Average 3-5 times a day.

### Fat

Avoid the solid fat will be a helpful way to avoid overtaking of fat, for example, avoid nuts, cakes, and fat meat.

## Of Anaerobic Exercise

### Division

| Day 1                 | Day 2                        | Day3             | Day 4          | Day other    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Back + Front Shoulder | Chest + Back middle Shoulder | Biceps + Triceps | Leg+ Abdominal | Aerobic Only |

Always 4 sets of 3-4 types of motion, with 8-12 RM. Free complex motion first.

### Chest

Chest muscle connects upper arm, motion is Shoulder joint horizontal clip motion. 
That requires all motion, 
grip wilder than shoulder.

Motion is classified into 3 classes: 
Of lateral press(90 degree), 
Of incline press(arm-head acute, arm-abd obtuse), 
Of decline press(arm-head obtuse, arm-abd acute). 

All bench press should make lower arm be vertical to ground. 
All press requires scapula（肩胛骨) sink(but not intend).
All press requires full grip, with slight lie down wrist to make platform
Decline down to nipples line, narrow grip; 
Lateral in the middle, normal grip;
Incline up to clavicle downside, wider grip, bench 30 degree.

Dumbbell press suggested grip inner side, to prevent it falling inside. Does not need clip motion 

Push-ups includes 3 motions at the same time, while start from lateral,
press up as decline, press down as incline. 

Bar-Dip is decline, thus try to avoid straight up&down(which turn it into triceps training).
1. Hip flexed, feet pointing forward, ass back, upper body lining forward.
2. Arched back, drawn chest.
3. Grip wider than shoulder

## Of Supplement

### Sun Yang's Testing Incident

This is a test for Math

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
