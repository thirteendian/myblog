## `__proto__` & `prototype` & `constructor`

For analysis each question, three point:

1. (`constructor`)function's constructor use which function
2. (`prototype`)function is inherited from which object
3. (`__proto__`)function has parent reference point to which object

Note 2. & 3. are describing same thing.

1. **The `function(object).prototype` is what we write as an Function(Object)'s defination.**
   Which put all method that is ready to be inherited by other class, whereby calling this function to instantiate.


2. The **constructor** is in `function(object).prototype` as
   `function(object).prototype.constructor()`
   provide the method to instantiate a `function(object)`.

3. The instantiation that inherited from `function.prototype`
   have referece `__proto__` point to `function.prototype`. Similar to Java Object, all objects has `__proto__`
   reference point to
   `Object.prototype`.
4. Similar to Java, `Object.prototype` contains many predefined method such as `toString()`.
5. Since `f Function()` is also considered to be constructed, and it's constructor is in `f Function.prototype`. That is
   to say, `f Function.prototype.constructor` is used as all function's constructor, that is construct by expression "
   var example = function(){}".

_**So when we say "use function as constructor", means use Function.prototype.constructor()!!!**_

For example, suppose define function `Parent()`, using constructor `Function.prototype.constructor()`, in another word,
function `Parent` inherited from object `Function.prototype`, and `Parent` has reference `Parent.__proto__`
point to object `Function.prototype`. Also, according to the previous analogy, all function's prototype is inherited
from `Object.prototype`, so does `Function.prototype`.

```jsx
var Parent = function () {
}
//Parent()'s constructor function is Function.prototype.constructor()
//Parent is inherited from Function.prototype
//Parent has reference Parent.__proto__ point to Function.prototype
//Function's constructor function is Function.prototype.constructor().
//Function is inherited from Function.prototype
//Function has reference Function.__proto__ point to Function.prototype
//Function.prototype's constructor function is itself
//Function.prototype is inherited from Object.prototype
//Function.prototype has reference Function.prototype.__proto__ point to Object.prototype
//Object's constructor function is f Function.prototype.constructor()
//Object is inherited from Function.prototype
//Object has reference Object.__proto__ point to Object.prototype
//Object.prototype's constructor is NULL
//Object.prototype is inherited from NULL
//Object.prototype has referemce Object.prototype.__proto__ point to NULL
//* Note also Parent() is only a function here.
```

suppose object `p1` construct using constructor `Parent()`, in another word, object`p1()` inherited from
object `Parent.prototype`.
`p1` has reference `p1.__proto__`to parent object `Parent.prototype`.

```jsx
var p1 = new Parent();
// p1's constructor is Parent.prototype.constructor()
// p1 is inherited from Parent.prototype
// p1 has reference p1.__proto__ to Parent.prototype
```

If one want to put value not in prototype but in it's own instantiation, a single assignment to an variable is
necessary:

```jsx
class A

()
{
    constructor()
    {
    }
    a = 1;
//constructor will construct a=1 in new instantiation
//but we cannot find a=1 in instantiation.__proto__
//(or A.prototype)
}
```

Note that the following map when say function(object) constructor, that means use it's function(object)
.prototype.constructor!

## `this` in JS

To justify `this` referece.

In no-strict mode, undefined normally be `window`; In strict mode is undefined.

* Inside of function EventHandler, is the element.
* Outside of function, strict/no-strict, is global object. For example, window
* Inside of function, no-strict, is global object. For example, window.
* Inside of function, strict, is undefined. **Note Babel will translate component function to be strict mode**
* Inside of object, is object. Not include static methods.
* As object's method, is the object.(Normally object's method is set to be strict automatically, thus is undefined)
* As of function(object)'s constructor, is new object(instantiation). If have return, the new object value is defined by
  return
* As object's own method(not in prototype),
  **defined by "()=>"**, is outside scope(the object instantiation)
* Can be changed by bind()

An example about object's method

```js
class A {
    constructor(...) {...
    }

    render(...) {...
    }

    example(...) {
        console.log(this);
    }
}

//Call by instantiation
// `this` is point to the instantiation
const test1 = new A(...)
test1.example()

//Call directly
//object method is in heap
//(create another reference in stack to class method in heap)
//`this` is undefined
//because object's method will open strict mode automatically
const test2 = test1.example()
test2()//undefined
```

To solve this problem, we can bind the function's to it's instantiation, or use "()=>" to define the function as
following:

```js
class A {
    constructor(...) {
    ...
        this.example2 = this.example1().bind(this);
    }

    render(...) {...
    }

    example1(...) {
        console.log(this);
    }

    //this is not a function defination
    //but a assignment expression
    //this can not be tracked by instantiation.__proto__
    example3 = () => {
        console.log(this);
    };
}

//Call directly
//object method is in heap
//(create another reference in stack to class method in heap)
//`this` is class A
//Because this.example's this has been binded to
//the instantiation.
const test2 = new A().example2()
test2()//class A

//Note the bind method is still example1,
//since righto this.example2 is get from prototype,
//and bind() return a new function with new bind of this,
//so it's acutally get a "modified" example1, and 
//give it to prototype's example2.
//When new A() is called, 
// example2 is constructed out by constructor from prototype


//example is an instantiation method, defined by ()=>
//so "this" is pointed to outsider scope which is the 
//instantiation 
const test3 = new A().example3()
test3()//class A


```

**Note that object do not have it's constructor, the constructor is on `object.prototype`, while methods is defined
in `object.prototype` as well. Thus for expression "this.example2 = this.example1().bind(this);", the right side is
fetching this(`object.prototype`).example1 method from `object.prototype`, the left side is construct this(`object`) as
a new object with new method `example2()`**

## Closure

`var` used to create function scope variable inside a function, if one does not use `var` to create variable, actually
an Global scope variable is created.

Java's if else blocks does not create scope for `var`, thus if create statement with bracket blocks,
`var` inside actually create Global scope variable. On the other hand ES6 use `let` and `global` to create block scope
variable.

```js
functionO()
{
    var variable;
    return functionI()
    {
        return variable;
    }
}
functionI_instance = functionO();
```

The function will maintain reference to it's _lexical environment_, when functionI is inside functionO, it's lexical
environment is functionO's lexical environment, thus functionI will maintain reference to all **block scope** variable
that defined in functionO. Pratically, we will return functionI inside of functionO to access functionO even functionO
is died. In anther word, keep FunctionO's variable keep in memory.

Note that to delete closure function variable to prevent memory leaking.
